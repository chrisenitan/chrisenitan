## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my Github profile page. 

- I'm usually online somewhere so do not hesitate to reach out on any topic.

Life is not `1` and `0`, its `1s` and `0s`; I do not `0` or `-0` percent believe that we live in a simulation, so my whole life has been about leveraging that; I conceptualise scenarios, crunch through the best cases and act the most plausible. I do let go sometimes but most times, Iâ€™m focused on properly diffusing my thoughts. â€¦becomes words, become actions, become habits, become character, this is destiny.

**_trust unto god and he shall direct your path_**
